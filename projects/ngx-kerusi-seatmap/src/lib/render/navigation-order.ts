 * Keyboard navigation order over a seat map.
 *
 * §4.3.1 gives `col` a second job beyond drawing: it is the *logical adjacency
 * ordinal*, which is exactly what "the seat to my right" must mean for a
 * keyboard or a screen reader. That holds in `mixed` sections too, where
 * `x`/`y` places the seat but `col` still orders it — so a stand curving away
 * from the pitch still reads seat 1, 2, 3.
 *
 * Freeform sections have no columns. Where their seats carry a `row` label,
 * that grouping is used; where they carry nothing, seats are banded by `y` and
 * ordered by `x`. That last case is a heuristic, and documented as one.
